            <h2>Street Art explained</h2>
            <p>Street art is a form of visual art created in public spaces, often on the streets, walls, buildings, and other publicly accessible surfaces. It encompasses a wide range of artistic expressions, including graffiti, murals, stencils, wheatpaste posters, and various other techniques. Street art is typically intended to be seen by the general public, and it often conveys social, political, or cultural messages.</p>
            <p>Here are some common forms of street art:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Graffiti</li>
                <li>Murals</li>
                <li>Stencils</li>
                <li>Wheatpaste Posters</li>
                <li>3D Street Art</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Street art has gained recognition as a legitimate form of artistic expression and has become an important aspect of contemporary art and urban culture. While some street artists work without permission, there are also legal avenues for creating street art, with many cities embracing it as a means of public art and cultural enrichment. However, the legality and acceptance of street art can vary widely depending on local regulations and community attitudes.</p>
